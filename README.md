# Oasis-Infobyte-Data-Science-Internship

This repository contains all the Data Science tasks I did during my Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship.

## Tasks Overview

1) [**Iris Flower Classification**](https://github.com/shashankarya9999/Oasis-Infobyte-Data-Science-Internship/tree/main/Iris-Flower-Classification)
    - Iris flower has three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
      measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
      their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the
      measurements of the iris species and classify them.
      
2) [**Unemployment Analysis with Python**](https://github.com/shashankarya9999/Oasis-Infobyte-Data-Science-Internship/tree/main/Unemployment-Analysis-with-Python)
3) [**Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning**](https://github.com/shashankarya9999/Oasis-Infobyte-Data-Science-Internship/tree/main/Car-Price-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning)
4) [**Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning**](https://github.com/shashankarya9999/Oasis-Infobyte-Data-Science-Internship/tree/main/Email-Spam-Detection-with-Machine-Learning)
5) [**Sales Prediction using Python**](https://github.com/shashankarya9999/Oasis-Infobyte-Data-Science-Internship/tree/main/Sales-Prediction-Using-Python)
